Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

This mod aims to provide an answer to the second question by expanding on the varieties of resistance genes. The increased resistance genes have a gradual increase of resistance based on how many genes are there. For example, if there are 2 resistance genes, then the resistances they add are 50%, and 0%(immunity). The vulnerabilities multiply damage taken, starting at x2 damage and increase by 2 each level(x2, x4, x6, etc).


This mod will eventually be put into Expanded Biotech Style Genes - All in One. If that mod exists and you still see this message, please let me know I forgot to add the link here.
